      ### Step 1. Access a file directory

      Here's the function we're going to build:

      * Access an AWS S3 directory
      * Filter for files where size < 50KB
      * Copy to cloud storage (e.g., Dropbox)

      The first step in the function is to access the sample Amazon S3 directory included with your Flex.io account. As you see in the console, we'll use the `list` task to read through each of the files in the directory.

      Click the **Run** button at the right to see the files.

    button:
      label: Next step
      action: next

      ### Step 2. Add a filter

      Now that we see our files, let's say we only want to move files that are less than 50KB in size. To do this, add a `filter` task like this:

      ```
      Flexio.pipe()
        .list('/flexio-public-s3')
        .filter('size <= 50000')
      ```

      Click the **Run** button again and you'll see the files that match this new criteria.

    button:
      label: Create connection
      action: storage

      ### Step 3. Create a connection to a cloud storage account

      To copy the files to cloud storage, we first need to set up a connection to an external account like Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive.

      Click **Create Connection** below to set up your account. After connecting, we'll insert the path into the next snippet using the new connection name.

    button:
      label: Next step
      action: next

      ### Step 4. Copy the filtered files to your cloud storage

      Now we'll copy the files from the S3 account to your cloud storage account. For this, we'll use three tasks in conjunction: `foreach`, `read` and `write`:

      ```
      Flexio.pipe()
        .list('/flexio-public-s3')
        .filter('size <= 50000')
        .foreach(
          Flexio.pipe()
            .read('/flexio-public-s3/${item.name}')
            .write('/{{connection_name}}/flexio-${process.time.unix}/${item.name}')
        )
        .echo('Finished!')
      ```

      **NOTE:** You'll notice that the name `{{connection_name}}` from the connection created in the previous step is referenced in the `write` command. Currently the files are placed in timestamped subfolders; if you want to place the files in a different location, simply update the path like this: `.write('/{{connection_name}}/foo/${item.name}')`.

      Add these tasks, click the **Run** button again and then check your cloud storage account to see the copied files.
