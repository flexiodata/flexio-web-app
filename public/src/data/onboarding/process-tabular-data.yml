      ### Step 1.  Access a CSV file from a directory

      Here's the pipe we're going to build:

      * Access a file from an AWS S3 directory
      * Convert text to a table
      * Select three fields
      * Copy to cloud storage (e.g., Dropbox)

      The first step in the pipe is to access a CSV file from the sample Amazon S3 directory included with your Flex.io account. As you see in the console, we'll use the `read` task to access the CSV.

      Click the **Run** button on the right to see the raw CSV data.

    button:
      label: Next step
      action: next

      ### Step 2. Add a conversion step

      Now we'll add a simple `convert` task that reformats the data from CSV to a table as follows:

      ```
      Flexio.pipe()
        .read('/{{username}}-flexio-public-s3/contact-list-1.csv')
        .convert('csv', 'table')
      ```

      Add this task and click the **Run** button again; you'll now see the output converted to a tabular format.

      action: next

      ### Step 3.  Add a processing step

      For this example, we'll add a `select` step to reduce the number of columns in the table. The CSV we are using is a fictitious contact list with 12 fields. We'll select the `First Name`, `Last Name` and `City` fields:

      ```
      Flexio.pipe()
        .read('/{{username}}-flexio-public-s3/contact-list-1.csv')
        .convert('csv', 'table')
        .select('firstname', 'lastname', 'city')
      ```

      Add this task and click the **Run** button again; now we see only the columns that we selected.

    button:
      label: Connect to storage
      action: storage

      ### Step 4. Create a connection to a cloud storage account

      To copy the files to cloud storage, we first need to set up a connection to an external account like Dropbox, Amazon S3, or Google Drive.

      Click **Connect to Storage** below to set up your account. After connecting, we'll insert the path into the next snippet using the new connection alias.

    button:
      label: Next step
      action: next

      ### Step 5. Transfer the file to your cloud storage

      Now we'll copy the file from the S3 account to your cloud storage account.  You just need to add a `write` task to your code as follows:

      ```
      Flexio.pipe()
        .read('/{{username}}-flexio-public-s3/contact-list-1.csv')
        .convert('csv', 'table')
        .select('firstname', 'lastname', 'city')
        .write('/{{connection_alias}}/flexio-${process.time.unix}/contact-list-1.csv')
      ```

      **NOTE:** You'll notice that the alias `{{connection_alias}}` from the connection created in the previous step is referenced in the `write` command. Currently the files are placed in timestamped subfolders; if you want to place the files in a different location, simply update the path like this: `.write('/{{connection_alias}}/foo/contact-list-1.csv')`.

      Add this task, click the **Run** button again and then check your cloud storage account to see the copied file.
