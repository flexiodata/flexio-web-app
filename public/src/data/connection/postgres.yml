        **NOTE:** If your database is protected by a firewall, you will need to grant Flex.io access to it. This can be done by allowing connections from the following IP address: 34.205.178.37.

        In addition, youâ€™ll need to grant SELECT access so that Flex.io is allowed to retrieve data from your database. The command is:

        <div class="code lh-title pa2 bg-nearer-white">
          GRANT SELECT ON your_database.your_table TO your_username@'34.205.178.37' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
        </div>
